# classifier
Description: Imported a dataset from Kaggle to predict whether customers would purchase products based on their detailed information. Utilized sklearn for data preprocessing, and employed various classification algorithms provided by sklearn, including Logistic Regression, SVM (Support Vector Machine), Na√Øve Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. Evaluated the results using a confusion matrix, compared the differences between these classifiers, and explored how to perform fine-tuning.
